Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic turn-based game where players place X or O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three identical symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winning line, the game ends in a draw.

Features
Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns using X and O.
Win Detection: Checks for winning combinations after each move.
Draw Detection: Declares a draw if the grid is filled with no winner.
Reset and New Game: Allows players to reset the board and start over.
Responsive Layout: Scales nicely on different screen sizes.
Gameplay
Open the Game: Launch index.html in your web browser.
Take Turns: The first click places an O, the second click places an X, and so on.
Win or Draw:
If a player’s symbol appears in a winning pattern (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), a Winner message appears.
If the board is filled with no winner, a Draw message appears.
Reset / New Game: Click the Reset or New Game button to clear the board and play again.

How to Run
Open index.html in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
Play by clicking on the squares to place O or X.
No additional installations or frameworks are required—everything runs in the browser.

Game Logic
Turn Management
A boolean (turn0) determines which symbol to place. If turn0 is true, place O; otherwise, place X.
Win Patterns
An array of arrays holds the 8 possible winning combinations, e.g., [0,1,2], [0,4,8], etc.
Move Count
A count variable tracks how many moves have been made. If count reaches 9 with no winner, the game is a draw.
Winner / Draw Display
If a winning combination is found, a message displays the winner and disables the board.
If all squares are filled with no winner, a draw message appears.
Future Improvements
Single-Player Mode: Implement an AI so one person can play against the computer.
Scoring System: Keep track of wins, losses, and draws.
Animations: Add CSS animations to highlight winning lines or transitions.
Mobile Optimization: Enhance the layout and controls for touch devices.
